# Omnidirectional-Basketball-Robot
A ROS-based omnidirectional robot integrating encoder feedback, IMU data, and PID control for smooth and precise motion. The system runs on a Raspberry Pi, receives commands from a PS4 controller, and handles real-time communication with sensors, motor drivers, and pneumatic actuators for responsive remote operation.
